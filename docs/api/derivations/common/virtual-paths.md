List of sources that will be made virtually available to your Typst project.
Useful for projects which rely on remote resources, such as
[images][typst-ref-image] or [data][typst-ref-data-loading].

Each element of the list is an attribute set with the following keys:

- `src`: path to source file or directory
- `dest` _(optional)_: path where file(s) will be made available (defaults to `.`)
  - If `src` is a directory, `dest` will be a directory containing the files in that directory.
    - Specifying the same `dest` for multiple `src` directories will merge them.
  - If `src` is a file, `dest` will be a copy of that file.

Instead of an attrset, you may use a path which will be interpreted the same as
if you had specified an attrset with just `src`.
